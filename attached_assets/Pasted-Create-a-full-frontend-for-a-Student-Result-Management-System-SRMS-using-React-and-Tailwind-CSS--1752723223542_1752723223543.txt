Create a full frontend for a "Student Result Management System" (SRMS) using React and Tailwind CSS. The goal is to build a clean, modern, and responsive dashboard-based interface for two user roles: Students and Teachers.

Main Features:

1. **Landing Page**:
   - Welcome message.
   - Login options for "Student" and "Teacher".

2. **Authentication Pages**:
   - Simple login page for each role (no real auth needed, just mock login).
   - Redirect to respective dashboards after login.

3. **Student Dashboard**:
   - Header with name and logout.
   - Sidebar or tabs with:
     - View Semester-wise Results.
     - View GPA/CGPA summary.
     - Download Transcript (mock button).
   - Main content area shows:
     - Table of results with Subject, Grade, Credits, Semester.
     - GPA calculation display.

4. **Teacher Dashboard**:
   - Header with name and logout.
   - Sidebar or tabs with:
     - Upload New Results (form with select Student, Subject, Grade, Semester).
     - View/Edit Submitted Results.
     - Search by student/semester.
   - Use mock student data to simulate form interactions.
   - Table to display submitted results with edit/delete buttons.

5. **General Requirements**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
   - Use React state for simulating data (no backend).
   - Pages/components:
     - `LoginPage`, `StudentDashboard`, `TeacherDashboard`, `ResultTable`, `UploadForm`, etc.
   - Add dummy data for students, subjects, and results.
   - Responsive design (mobile/tablet/desktop).
   - Dark mode toggle (optional but appreciated).
   - Clean layout using cards, tables, buttons, modals where needed.

6. **Extras (Optional)**:
   - GPA calculation logic in frontend.
   - Toast notifications (e.g., “Result uploaded successfully”).
   - Search/filter on result tables.

Target audience: educational institutions managing results securely. Keep design minimal and functional for real-world use.

Use modern React (Hooks, functional components). Final structure should be production-grade and readable.
